# Pantheon-CLI

Command Line Interface for Pantheon - A framework for building distributed evolvable multi-agent systems.

This package provides the CLI interface with integrated REPL functionality, using pantheon-agents and pantheon-toolsets as dependencies.

## Installation

```bash
pip install pantheon-cli
```

## Usage

```bash
pantheon-cli
```

The CLI includes an integrated REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop) for interactive sessions with Pantheon agents.

## Dependencies

- `pantheon-agents`: Core agent functionality
- `pantheon-toolsets`: Distributed toolsets for various tasks

## Development

This package extracts the CLI and REPL functionality from the main Pantheon project for cleaner separation of concerns.
